# About

This is a WSU-Themed Tower Defense Game developed for Android devices. This project was built with a team of five developers over the course of a college semester. The design and development process was completed through 2-week sprints under the Scrum methodology using Git for source control.

Players are able to place down WSU Towers to defend against waves of incoming enemies. By defeating enemies, players gain currency that they can spend to place more towers and/or upgrade existing ones. Players can win by defeating all waves but will lose if they let too many enemies pass their defenses. After the game is over, players are able to insert their name to add it to the current leaderboard.
